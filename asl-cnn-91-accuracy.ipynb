ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing, and is used by many hearing people as well."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTewGg3ev1oJFLxjJX5_yWWVMv4iz2x3eiXv0_Cbomh9g&usqp=CAU&ec=45682160)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Where did ASL originate?\n\n\nNo person or committee invented ASL. The exact beginnings of ASL are not clear, but some suggest that it arose more than 200 years ago from the intermixing of local sign languages and French Sign Language (LSF, or Langue des Signes Française). Today’s ASL includes some elements of LSF plus the original local sign languages; over time, these have melded and changed into a rich, complex, and mature language. Modern ASL and modern LSF are distinct languages. While they still contain some similar signs, they can no longer be understood by each other’s users."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Content%20Images/NIDCD-ASL-teen-2019.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How does ASL compare with spoken language?\n\n\nASL is a language completely separate and distinct from English. It contains all the fundamental features of language, with its own rules for pronunciation, word formation, and word order. While every language has ways of signaling different functions, such as asking a question rather than making a statement, languages differ in how this is done. For example, English speakers may ask a question by raising the pitch of their voices and by adjusting word order; ASL users ask a question by raising their eyebrows, widening their eyes, and tilting their bodies forward.\n\nJust as with other languages, specific ways of expressing ideas in ASL vary as much as ASL users themselves. In addition to individual differences in expression, ASL has regional accents and dialects; just as certain English words are spoken differently in different parts of the country, ASL has regional variations in the rhythm of signing, pronunciation, slang, and signs used. Other sociological factors, including age and gender, can affect ASL usage and contribute to its variety, just as with spoken languages.\n\nFingerspelling is part of ASL and is used to spell out English words. In the fingerspelled alphabet, each letter corresponds to a distinct handshape. Fingerspelling is often used for proper names or to indicate the English word for something."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328396430/figure/fig1/AS:683619848830976@1539999081795/The-26-letters-and-10-digits-of-American-Sign-Language-ASL.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How do most children learn ASL?\n\n\nParents are often the source of a child’s early acquisition of language, but for children who are deaf, additional people may be models for language acquisition. A deaf child born to parents who are deaf and who already use ASL will begin to acquire ASL as naturally as a hearing child picks up spoken language from hearing parents. However, for a deaf child with hearing parents who have no prior experience with ASL, language may be acquired differently. In fact, 9 out of 10 children who are born deaf are born to parents who hear. Some hearing parents choose to introduce sign language to their deaf children. Hearing parents who choose to have their child learn sign language often learn it along with their child. Children who are deaf and have hearing parents often learn sign language through deaf peers and become fluent."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/26FLfw01s8KVTiQgg/source.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Why emphasize early language learning?\n\n\nParents should expose a deaf or hard-of-hearing child to language as soon as possible. The earlier a child is exposed to and begins to acquire language, the better that child’s language, cognitive, and social development will become. Research suggests that the first few years of life are the most crucial to a child’s development of language skills, and even the early months of life can be important for establishing successful communication with caregivers. Thanks to screening programs in place at almost all hospitals in the United States and its territories, newborn babies are tested for hearing before they leave the hospital. If a baby has hearing loss, this screening gives parents an opportunity to learn about communication options. Parents can then start their child’s language learning process during this important early stage of development."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l4q8is5h72szZ3wha/source.gif)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n\ndatagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255, \n                             shear_range = 0.2,\n                             validation_split = 0.1, \n                             zoom_range = 0.2,  \n                             horizontal_flip = True,\n                             samplewise_center = True, \n                             samplewise_std_normalization = True)\n\ntraining_set = datagen.flow_from_directory('/kaggle/input/asl-alphabet-new-24/asl-alphabet/asl_train/asl_alphabet_train/', \n                                           target_size = (64, 64), \n                                           batch_size = 64,\n                                           class_mode = 'categorical',\n                                           subset = 'training')\n\ntest_set = datagen.flow_from_directory('/kaggle/input/asl-alphabet-new-24/asl-alphabet/asl_train/asl_alphabet_train/',\n                                       target_size = (64, 64), \n                                       batch_size = 64,\n                                       class_mode = 'categorical', \n                                       subset = 'validation')","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Using TensorFlow backend.\n","name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Found 64800 images belonging to 24 classes.\nFound 7200 images belonging to 24 classes.\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://mlnotebook.github.io/img/CNN/convSobel.gif)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization\n# Initialising the CNN\ncnn = Sequential()\n\n#First Layer\ncnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 64, kernel_size = (4, 4), \n                      input_shape = (64, 64, 3), activation = 'relu'))\n\ncnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 64, kernel_size = (4, 4), strides = 2,  activation = 'relu'))\n\ncnn.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\ncnn.add(BatchNormalization(axis = 3, momentum = 0.8))\n\n#Second Layer\ncnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 128, kernel_size = (4, 4), activation = 'relu'))\n\ncnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 128, kernel_size = (4, 4), strides = 2,  activation = 'relu'))\n\ncnn.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\ncnn.add(BatchNormalization(axis = 3, momentum = 0.8))\n\n#Third Layer\n\ncnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 256, kernel_size = (4, 4), activation = 'relu'))\n\ncnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 256, kernel_size = (4, 4), strides = 2,  activation = 'relu'))\n\ncnn.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\ncnn.add(BatchNormalization(axis = 3, momentum = 0.8))\n\n# Flattening\ncnn.add(Flatten())\n\ncnn.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\n# Hidden Layer and Output Layer\ncnn.add(Dense(units = 512, activation = 'relu'))\ncnn.add(Dense(units = 24, activation = 'softmax'))\n\n#Compiling the CNN\ncnn.compile(optimizer= 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SmoggyLittleFlickertailsquirrel-max-1mb.gif)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cnn.fit_generator(training_set, steps_per_epoch = 1013, epochs = 15,\n                         validation_data = test_set, validation_steps = 113)","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Epoch 1/15\n1013/1013 [==============================] -
